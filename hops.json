Ella grows vigorously, producing moderately large, dense cones which mature mid- to late-season, with a broad harvest window helping to ensure excellent physical and chemical quality in the final product. With an alpha acid content of ~15%, Ella is an aroma hop with options. This newly developed aroma hop deserves experimentation – the hoppy characters and texture on the palate would provide a new twist to a pilsner or lager, while the floral characters could provide a highlight in a wide range of beer styles. Offers the ideal alternative aroma range to Hallertauer hops.",

This robust hop contributes all the essential characteristics of flavour, aroma and balanced bitterness to ales, particularly as its relatively low alpha acid content requires a high hopping rate to achieve desired bitterness levels. Sometimes used as a distinctive dry hop. Due to low alpha levels, usually used to impart grassy late-hop aroma to Bitters and Pale ales. Fuggles are also suitable for Porters and Stouts where earthy and Hawthorn aromas are evident. May suit certain darker Biére de Garde too.\r\n",

Because of its moderate alpha content and pleasant aroma, this variety is particularly well- suited as a dual purpose hop. Northern Brewer is grown not only in the USA, but also in England and Germany. In both the raw hops and the cold infusion of this cultivar, the predominant aromas are of citrus, mandarin and lime. In the raw hops, the flavour profile is augmented by sweet fruits such as pineapple and red strawberries, menthol and light notes of cream caramel. In the cold infusion, watermelon, peach and apricot in particular come to the forefront.",

This cultivar has only been in commercial production since 2013 and is still an insider’s tip, as its name suggests. Both the raw hops and the cold infusion of this cultivar are strongly characterised by green fruits, such as gooseberries and quince, sweet candied fruits, citrus notes of grapefruit and red berries, such as strawberries. Pineapple and passion fruit are also particularly prominent. The overall aroma profile is rounded off with intense floral notes of rose and apple blossom.",

Provides a distinctive sweet fruit flavour in beer, similar to but generally more pronounced and robust than Goldings. It gives a mild clean bitterness and is sometimes used with good effect as a distinctive dry hop. Traditionally best suited to British Bitters and Pale Ales but may find use in Biére de Garde, Saison and Wheat beers too. Fresh green plant-like character can also be effective in Amber, Märzen and Oktoberfest-style lagers.",

Bursting with juicy stone fruit and tropical notes, this dual-purpose hop has been featured in many great beers since its release in 2010. Big Alpha Acids (13-17%) make this an effective and efficient bittering hop, but can be used in late additions to maximize the fresh, fruity aroma and flavor. El Dorado is an exceptional new dual purpose hop with both high Alpha Acid and intense flavors and aromas. As a bittering hop El Dorado lends a firm but balanced bitterness. When used in later additions, El Dorado brings bright tropical fruit flavors and aromas of pear, watermelon, and stone fruit. El Dorado has become a fan favorite in hop-forward styles and has been featured in stellar beers such as Surly's Overrated IPA, Ninkasi's Dawn of the Red, and Let it Ride from Indeed Brewing.\r\n\r\n",

A touch of sweet fruity aroma rounds out this well-balanced hop. In beer, the floral notes are accentuated yet complemented nicely by fruity and citrus with just a hint of herbal. Don’t expect an in-your-face fruity character with Loral™ as seen with some recent U.S. variety releases - this hop is approachable and balanced.
